# additional information about the "hdblcm"-tool
# from SAP HANA Administration Guide / SAP HANA 2.0 Vers.01 2016-11-30# 
# & SAP HANA Server Installation Guide / SAP HANA 2.0 Vers. 01 2017-04-12
# & SAP NOTE 2078425 #19 / 2016-06-17
#
# The SAP HANA database lifecycle manager (HDBLCM) is used to install, update, or configure an SAP HANA system. 
# You can use the SAP HANA database lifecycle manager in graphical user, command-line, or Web user interface
# "Batch-mode" can only be performed in commandline mode.
# The SAP HANA database lifecycle manager is available in two varieties - an installation medium version to perform installation and update, and a resident version
# for update and configuration that is unpacked on the SAP HANA host during installation or update.
# Every time you install or update an SAP HANA system, you can be sure that any subsequent configuration tasks performed with the SAP HANA database lifecycle manager
# will work as expected because the installation or update tool and the configuration tool are of the same version and have been tested together. The SAP HANA resident 
# HDBLCM is located at <sapmnt>/<SID>/hdblcm.
#
# ./hdblcm --batch --configfile=/var/tmp/<SID>_configfile
#
# When using batch mode, passwords must either be defined in the configuration file, or passed to the installer using an XML password file and streamed in via standard 
# input. In both cases, it is necessary to prepare the passwords.
# To execute tasks as the system administrator use user <SID>adm.
#
# If parameters are specified in the command line, they override the corresponding parameters in the configuration file. Parameters in the configuration file override default settings. 
# Order of parameter precedence: Command Line > Configuration File > Default
#
# SAP HANA resident HDBLCM directory: 
# cd <sapmnt>/<SID>/hdblcm 
# Start the SAP HANA platform lifecycle management tool:
# ./hdblcm --batch <additional parameters>
# or
# ./hdblcm -b <additional parameters>
# It is mandatory to provide an SAP HANA system ID (SID) and user passwords during installation. 
# In batch mode, you are restricted to providing these parameter values as call options on the command line (for
# passwords, by means of an XML file) or in a configuration file. If you don't provide parameter values for the
# other required parameters, you implicitly accept the default values.

# 
# (add_roles)
# #####
# Specifies additional roles for exisiting SAP HANA hosts during SAP HANA option installation. Multiple host roles are not supported in production environments.
